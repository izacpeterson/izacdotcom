          Hey There! I'm <em>Izac.</em> Pretty cool right? How many people do
          you know spell it like that? Yeah I'm unique, but not just in name. I
          build awesome webisites too. Like this one you're reading now. Isn't
          it great! I mean, it's probably not the best, but not bad for someone
          who's mostly self taught.
        </p>

          I was born and raised here in Utah. I attended Lehi High School.
          During that time I took every computer and programming class that I
          could. I did attend MTECH during my senior year, studying Digital
          Media. I really enjoy doing that, but I've found I'd rather keep that
          as a hobby rather than a career. I spent two years serving a mission
          for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Baltimore
          Maryland.

          I currently work at Blade HQ. We sell knives. A lot of knives. Any
          kind of knife you need, we probably have it. I started as a customer
          sevice rep, and quickly worked my way into a Senior Representative
          position. During that time, I was offered to learn about fraud
          prevention and help our Fraud Specialist out a bit with that. After he
          left the company, I took over his position. In that position I have
          worked on our IT team, preventing fraudulent transactions on our
          website.

          I recently started the Web Development course at MTECH. I look forward
          to learning and developing new skills over the coming months. I love
          coding, and am looking to begin a career in this feild.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't spend all my time typing code though. I have some other fun
          hobbies, such as CGI arts and astrophotography! I really enjoy
          creating digital landscapes on worlds that only exist in my
          imagination and on my hard drive. Astrophotography is a fun one too.
          It's hard, frustrating, and time consuming. Maybe that's what makes it
          fun though? My favorite deep sky objects to photograph are the
          Andromeda Galaxy, and the Heart Nebula.
        </p>

          My favorite foods include pizza, crabcakes, and hamburgers. My
          favorite restaurants include Red Robin, Straptank, and the Smoking
          Apple
