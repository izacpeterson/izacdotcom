      <p>
        Hey There! I'm Izac. Pretty cool right? How many people do you know
        spell it like that? Yeah I'm unique, but not just in name. I build
        awesome webisites too. Like this one you're reading now. Isn't it great!
        I mean, it's probably not the best, but not bad for someone who's mostly
        self taught.
      </p>

        I was born and raised here in Utah. I attended Lehi High School. During
        that time I took every computer and programming class that I could. I
        did attend MTECH during my senior year, studying Digital Media. I really
        enjoy doing that, but I've found I'd rather keep that as a hobby rather
        than a career. I spent two years serving a mission for the Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Baltimore Maryland.

        I currently work at Blade HQ. We sell knives. A lot of knives. Any kind
        of knife you need, we probably have it. I started as a customer sevice
        rep, and quickly worked my way into a Senior Representative position.
        During that time, I was offered to learn about fraud prevention and help
        our Fraud Specialist out a bit with that. After he left the company, I
        took over his position. In that position I have worked on our IT team,
        preventing fraudulent transactions on our website.

        I recently started the Web Development course at MTECH. I look forward
        to learning and developing new skills over the coming months. I love
        coding, and am looking to begin a career in this feild.

        I don't spend all my time typing code though. I have some other fun
        hobbies, such as CGI arts and astrophotography! I really enjoy creating
        digital landscapes on worlds that only exist in my imagination and on my
        hard drive. Astrophotography is a fun one too. It's hard, frustrating,
        and time consuming. Maybe that's what makes it fun though? My favorite
        deep sky objects to photograph are the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Heart
        Nebula.

        My favorite foods include pizza, crabcakes, and hamburgers. My favorite
        restaurants include Red Robin, Straptank, and the Smoking Apple
