        <p>Hello, my name is Izac and I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I first discovered my interest in programming and web development while taking classes in high school. I continued my education by studying WebDev at MTECH and honing my skills in this field.</p>
        <p>In addition to web development, I have a variety of hobbies that inspire my creativity. I enjoy creating CGI art and taking photographs, including astrophotography. When I'm not in front of my computer, you can find me hiking or kayaking, exploring the great outdoors.</p>
        <p>With my combined skills and interests, I strive to create websites that not only look great but also deliver exceptional functionality and user experience. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the web development industry to provide the best possible results for my clients.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects. If you have any questions or inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
